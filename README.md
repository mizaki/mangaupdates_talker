# MangaUpdates plugin for Comic Tagger

A plugin for [Comic Tagger](https://github.com/comictagger/comictagger/releases) to allow the use of the metadata from [MangaUpdates](https://mangaupdates.com).

## Work in progress

The 'master' branch attempts to be current with comictagger 'develop' branch

When using the GUI the issues window list will always be empty as MangaUpdates does not store issue level information. Clicking `OK` will tag using the available series data.

## Install

`pip install .`
If ComicTagger is not installed in your Python environment already `pip install comictagger` (plus any other optional dependancies required `[GUI]` etc.)
